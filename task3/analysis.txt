# Analyse (Teilaufgabe c)

Ich habe die Graphen mit den drei verschiedenen Modellen (TF-IDF, MiniLM-V6 und Distiluse) analysiert. Ich habe distiluse-base-multilingual-cased-v1 ausgewählt, weil des darauf trainiert ist semantische zusammenhänge zu erkennen und das wollte ich testen :). Dabei habe ich die wichtigsten Sätze und Knoten identifiziert, sowie einige statistische Kennzahlen berechnet. Die Analyse zeigt, dass TF-IDF im gegensatz zu den Modellen eine wesentlich weniger dichte Struktur im Graphen aufweist. Aufgrund von TF-IDFs Fokus auf Worthäufigkeiten sind auch die 'wichtigsten' Sätze die, mit den meisten Wörtern, vielen 'the', 'and' 'a' etc. Die Modelle zeigen deutlich dichtere Graphen, höhere Grade der Knoten und vor allem beim MiniLM-V6 Modell große Communities. Es lässt sich darauf schließen, dass die Modelle in der Lage sind, semantische Beziehungen zwischen den Sätzen zu erkennen und zu nutzen, während TF-IDF nur auf der Häufigkeit von Wörtern basiert. Die Qualität einer Zusammenfassung für den Textausschnitt aus "1984" von George Orwell aus 5 Sätzen ist bei allen Varianten nicht fantastisch, aber die Modelle sind in der Lage, die wichtigsten Sätze zu identifizieren und eine gewisse Kohärenz zu erzeugen. Chat-GPT wählt im Vergleich die folgenden Sätze aus:

“It was a bright cold day in April, and the clocks were striking thirteen.”

“BIG BROTHER IS WATCHING YOU, the caption beneath it ran.”

“The instrument (the telescreen, it was called) could be dimmed, but there was no way of shutting it off completely.”

“The thing that he was about to do was to open a diary.”

“His pen had slid voluptuously over the smooth paper, printing in large neat capitals – DOWN WITH BIG BROTHER DOWN WITH BIG BROTHER DOWN WITH BIG BROTHER DOWN WITH BIG BROTHER DOWN WITH BIG BROTHER over and over again, filling half a page.”

Häufig sind das interessanter Weise Randsätze von Paragraphen. Evtl. vermutet das Modell, so gleichmäßig aus dem Text zu wählen und jeden Paragraphen zu berücksichtigen. Unten die Werte der Analyse:
